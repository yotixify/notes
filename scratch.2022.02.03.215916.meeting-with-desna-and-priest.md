Eventually we see a tall man walk up wearing a chainshirt. [[Baylor|scratch.2022.02.03.214439.baylor]] walks up and talks to us about a possible mission. We need to talk to [[Devron|scratch.2022.02.03.214549.devron]]. Devron likes talking to Amarille more than me. 

Desna Priest shows up, Martin is neutral about it.  We have a new mission, a scout party was sent out but has not returned. There are screams and wolf howls in the night where the cave in happened. 

Screaming and howling, an unearthed blade.
