## Vignette

Swiftly and Quietly Amarille packs her bags for a long day ahead. Quietly she sleeps out before the sunrises as she has a long day ahead. She gently shuts her door and slips out the front door of the manor, swiflty dodging the creaking wood floor panels Kuriel refuses to fix. She doesn't mind though, it makes for a fun game as she sneaks out early in the morning. As the cool air hits her face she draws in a deep breath, the cool morning air filling her lungs and lifting her chest. "This is what I needed, some space to think." She quickly disappears into the dark. As she walks her mind wanders from memories of their adventures. Life has been chaotic for the past year while they have been adventuring many happy moments and sad, she remebers grenley saving them when they fought the zombies in the manor, fear grips her as she remembers the vargul bite and its cold dread, but most of all she remembers Davok and the times they stayed up drinking and laughing. A tear comes to her eye as she thinks about Davok...Davok dieing changed it all and brought her to the decision she has now. Does she stay with the party or does she leave?


As the sun is just beginning to rise she finds herself a nice spot in the woods where slim trees form almost a circle around a patch of leaves and grass. Amarille clears the leaves away and sits down to meditate, she has a lot the think about. The sun continues to rise as she meditates on what to do? "Calistria gave me a mission and I have gotten no where on it, have I failed her?" Some time passes and sun hits her face, "it's early morning now, shops will be opening I should be on my way."  Throughout the day Amarille picks up new gear prepping for either leaving the party or staying...she needs better gear regardless." 

Evening arrives as Amarille finishes shopping, she passes a small tavern where lively cheer and music pours out. A pint sounds amazing right now. Inside the bar smells of ale and roast pork fill her noise as her stomach grumbles. The bar is full but Amarille manages to squeeze in "Is this seat taken?" the half-orc nods and goes back to eating. she gets her ale, says a prayer to calistria and toasts Davok. Her mind made up she chugs her ale, slams it down and orders another. Tonight is a night of new beginnings. After many rounds of ale and drinking with locals, Amarille  left and went home.
