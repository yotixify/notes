## Character Name
Amarille Hellfire

## Locations
[[Magnamar|scratch.2022.02.03.215523.magnamar]]

## Synopsis

We all gave some vignettes about our characters, then had a dinner where we talked about the dangers ahead. There was some tension as we discussed life and death, but we ended with a better mutal understanding of eachother. Kahlan Amnell comes up and is ready to fight along with 20 people ready to fight and their families so 30-40 camp followers. 60-70 people total. 

Amarille and Kuriel are recognized with fanfare and cheering at Sandpoint. We are offered bread, flowers, etc. The townsfolk however are nervous and confused on where the other heros of Sandpoint are.
