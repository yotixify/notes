## Problem Statement
I need a better way of taking notes so I can refer back to them later. This includes not just my own personal notes but also work notes including todos, general notes, workouts, etc. 


## Solution
In this [dendron tutorial](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/593206ea-5658-4874-bafd-18a138870f91/) the speaker talks about how he uses a daily journal, weekly journal, and yearly journal. I like storing these concepts in root because they are easy to access. Im curious on what I should use for sps root.
